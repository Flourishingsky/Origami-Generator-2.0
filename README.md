# Origami-Generator-2.0
This software is developed based on an inverse origami design model that we proposed in the paper "Inverse origami design model for soft robotic development", aiming to assist users with or without experience in origami design to produce the origami with the desired cross-sectional shapes. The generated origami is constructed based on General Miura origami pattern and keeps axial compression. This version supports saving the flat crease pattern as independent DXF files 
for laser machine and exporting the 3D model of the origami into STL files.
